						<b>We as women we know how hard it is asking for support. <b>But not here!</b></b>
						</ul>
				<p>According to (CIO, 2024), despite national conversations about a lack of women in IT, women remain largely underrepresented in technology roles, according to a study by the National Science Foundation. And the pipeline doesn’t suggest a near-term correction — women accounted for just 21% of computer science degrees in 2020, up from 18% in 2011 but still lower than the 29% of women who held computer science degrees in 1995.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-7 mb-3 showtitle" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
						<p>And, according to recent data, representation of women in IT is trending in the wrong direction. According to the article (CIO, 2024), in 2022, more than half of companies lost 20% of their tech workforce to attrition, with women technologists (16%) leaving at a higher rate than men (13%). With twice as many women having left tech jobs in 2022 than in 2021, representation of women in the IT industry is currently at pre-pandemic levels, with 27% of technology roles filled by women compared to nearly 29% in 2020, according to data from AnitaB.org.</p>
						<p>Such issues have played a large role in the rise of organizations focused on empowering and supporting women in tech roles. Today’s networking and advocacy landscape finds a growing array of programs and organizations for girls, women, and anyone who identifies as a woman — and plenty are also open to male allies. In (CIO, 2024) you can check 20 key organizations dedicated to uplifting women in tech, pushing inclusivity in the workplace and closing the diversity gap. But below, you have a preview of some of the organizations that we have partnership with.</p>

						</ul>
					<p>The <b><a style="color:#001324; text-decoration:none" href="https://anitab.org/">AnitaB.org</a></b> is a nonprofit organization for women in tech that was founded in 1997 by computer scientists Anita Borg and Telle Whitney. The organization seeks to support women in technology and to “connect, inspire, and guide women in computing.” AnitaB.org also includes Systers, which was founded in 1987 by Anita Borg as the first online community for women in tech. Systers is still functioning today and is now the “largest email community of women in technical computing” with more than 8,500 members worldwide (CIO, 2024).</p>

						</ul>
						<p>The <b><a style="color:#001324; text-decoration:none" href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech</a></b> is a nonprofit organization that aims to stop gender inequality in the tech industry by empowering women through coding courses, bootcamps, and hackathons for girls and women of all ages and professions. The mission is to “support women with the access and community they need to succeed in tech.” They started in San Francisco in 2007 and has since grown to include more than 62,000 members. Events and programs vary by chapter and are designed to suit the specific needs of each community (CIO, 2024).</p>

						<p>Kimberly founded <b><a style="color:#001324; text-decoration:none" href="https://www.wearebgc.org/">Black Girls Code</a></b> because she felt culturally isolated in her electrical engineering and computer programming courses in college. While women are underrepresented in STEM fields, that’s even more true for women of color working in the industry. Black Girls Code is an organization that aims to support young girls of color to help give them the resources they need to succeed. Sparking an interest in tech at a young age is important to show them that a career in tech is an option (CIO, 2024).</p>
