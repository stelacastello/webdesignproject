		<br>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%">Despite national conversations about a lack of women in IT, women remain largely underrepresented in technology roles, according to a study by the National Science Foundation. And the pipeline doesn’t suggest a near-term correction — women accounted for just 21% of computer science degrees in 2020, up from 18% in 2011 but still lower than the 29% of women who held computer science degrees in 1995.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%">And, according to recent data, representation of women in IT is trending in the wrong direction. In 2022, more than half of companies lost 20% of their tech workforce to attrition, with women technologists (16%) leaving at a higher rate than men (13%). With twice as many women having left tech jobs in 2022 than in 2021, representation of women in the IT industry is currently at pre-pandemic levels, with 27% of technology roles filled by women compared to nearly 29% in 2020, according to data from AnitaB.org.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%">Such issues have played a large role in the rise of organizations focused on empowering and supporting women in tech roles. Today’s networking and advocacy landscape finds a growing array of programs and organizations for girls, women, and anyone who identifies as a woman — and plenty are also open to male allies. Here are 20 key organizations dedicated to uplifting women in tech, pushing inclusivity in the workplace and closing the diversity gap.</p>
